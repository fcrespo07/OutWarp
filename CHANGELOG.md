# Changelog

All notable changes to OutWarp are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(pre-1.0: minor bumps may carry user-visible changes).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-04

Hardening pass after a full code + UX audit, plus CI automation for the Windows
installer.

### Security
- `config.json` and `config.original.json` (which hold the client's WireGuard
  private key) are now written atomically at `0o600`. Previously they were
  created at the process umask — world-readable on a typical Linux box.
- The server's WireGuard config (Linux, Kubernetes and Windows platforms) goes
  through the same atomic `0o600` helper — no `0o644`→`chmod` window where the
  server private key is exposed.
- The DNS probe in `detect_hostile_network()` uses a random transaction ID
  instead of a fixed one, so an on-path attacker can't pre-forge a match.

### Fixed
- TUI no longer freezes: the client dashboard runs `StatsSampler.sample()`
  (subprocess `wg`/`ping`) in an executor instead of on the event loop, and
  `disconnect`/`reconnect`/`quit` off-load `manager.stop()` so the UI stays
  responsive during the watchdog-thread join.
- `reconnect.max_attempts` / `delays_seconds` are validated when parsing the
  `.owcfg` (a `max_attempts=0` no longer causes a silent instant failure).
- `top_talkers()` computes per-step `LAG()` deltas with reset-clamping instead
  of `MAX-MIN`, so an interface restart no longer shows a phantom multi-GB spike.
- Closed a race in `Api._replace_manager` (profile swap) via the new
  `TunnelManager.remove_listener()` — the old manager is detached before it can
  emit state changes that contradict the new one.
- The stats/latency loops join on stop instead of dropping the thread reference,
  preventing two loops from writing `self._stats` after a quick reconnect.
- Server `get_live_peers` failure-dedup state is guarded by a lock (was a bare
  module global, not thread-safe across the GUI/TUI pollers).

### Changed
- Tunnel state is now shown on the TUI dashboard's `StatusCard` — a disconnected
  (e.g. `auto_connect=off`) tunnel is no longer visually identical to a
  connected one.
- TUI colour tokens are centralised in `tui/tokens.py` (client + server) and
  aligned to the canonical `ui/styles.css` palette (`warn #ff8a3d`,
  `bad #ff4d6d`) — GUI and TUI no longer drift.
- The GUI `HostileBanner` is visually distinct from the `IntegrityBanner`
  (brand/info colour + shield icon in `auto` mode) so an automatic DNS-bypass
  doesn't read as an error the user must fix.
- The server TUI Logs screen tails `wg-quick@wg0` alongside `wstunnel`, so
  WireGuard handshake/interface failures are visible without leaving the TUI.
- Profile-validation messages are unified to English across config/TUI/GUI.
- The connecting stepper gains a final "ready" step to match the GUI; Doctor's
  "apply fix" binding is `f` (not `F`); the Doctor remediation command adapts to
  the host package manager (apt/dnf/pacman/zypper/apk); Help modal and the
  server's no-config screen are more actionable.

### Added
- `.github/workflows/windows-installer.yml`: on a published Release (or via
  `workflow_dispatch` against a tag) a `windows-latest` runner builds the
  full/client/server `OutWarpSetup-*.exe` editions and attaches them — plus a
  merged `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering wheels and installers — to the Release. The
  Windows `.exe` is no longer a manual step. Code-signing stays opt-in via
  `build.py`'s `OUTWARP_SIGN_*` env vars.
- Two tests for `run_daemon` (no profile → exit 2; start→stop→0).

## [0.6.0] — earlier

Daemon mode (`outwarp-cli daemon` + `service install|uninstall|status`), ~97×
faster connect (connection pooling + MTU), and anti-DPI groundwork
(`hostile_mode`, websocket keepalive, `:443` omission). See the project history
in git and the "Estado actual" section of `CLAUDE.md` for releases before 0.7.0.
